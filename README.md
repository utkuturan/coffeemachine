OOP Coffee Machine Simulator
Project Overview:

This Python project simulates a coffee machine using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The simulator provides a basic coffee ordering and dispensing experience.

Project Structure:

coffee_maker.py: Contains the core logic for the coffee machine, including resource management, menu, and payment processing.
main.py: The main entry point of the program, where the simulation starts.
menu.py: Defines the available coffee options and their prices.
money_machine.py: Handles monetary transactions, such as coin insertion and change calculation.

How to Run:
Clone the repository.
Ensure you have Python installed.
Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Run python main.py to start the coffee machine simulator.
Functionality:

Offers a selection of coffee drinks with different prices.
Simulates resource management (water, coffee beans, milk, cups).
Handles coin insertion and provides change.
Provides basic user interaction through the console.

Limitations:
Does not include a graphical user interface.
Does not handle advanced features like refill options or machine maintenance.
Potential Improvements:

Add a graphical user interface for better user experience.
Implement more realistic resource management (e.g., consider temperature).
Expand coffee options and customization.
Incorporate user profiles and preferences.
